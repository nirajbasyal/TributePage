        <h1>Here's a time line of Mahatma's life:</h1>
        <div class="listtext">
            <ul>
                <li><span>1869</span>- Born at Porbandar, India</li>
                <li><span>1883</span>- Got married to Kasturba Makhandas Kapadia at a young age of 13, as per the
                    prevalent regional custom at that time.</li>
                <li><span>1888</span>- Dropped out of college and left to study law at London. His family was
                    against
                    his decision to move to london for studying law. They feared that he would abandon his religion
                    and
                    family after going to Britain. But he dissuaded them by taking a vow that he would abstain from
                    meat,alcohol and women during his stusies there. He kept his words.</li>
                <li><span>1891</span>- Graduated as a Barrister from London and returned to India. Tried to
                    establish a
                    law business at the then Bombay for 2 years but failed.
                </li>
                <li><span>1893</span>- Went to South Africa to work as a lawyer for a shipping company. He spent 21
                    years in South Africa. This period turned out to be the turning point in his life. After
                    suffering
                    the atrocious racist regime first hand, he took up the cause of fellow Indians and tought them
                    to
                    fight back by using non-violent means.
                </li>
                <li><span>1906</span>- Launched his idea of Satyagraha or They way of the Truth to protest against a
                    new
                    law requiring compulsory registraion of Indians and Chinese.
                </li>
                <li><span>1915</span>- Returned to India and joined the Indian National Congress. His orientation to
                    Indian political situation, Indian people and their issues happened under the tutelage of Gopal
                    Krishna Gokhale.
                </li>
                <li><span>1917</span>- His first major achievement came during the Champaran peasants movement of
                    Bihar.
                    Gandhi squeezed out much of the demands of the peasants from the British authorities after
                    successfully leading a popular non-violent agitation.
                </li>
                <li><span>1930</span>- Gandhi organised the famous Salt March to Dandi from 12 March to 6 April,
                    where
                    he marched 388 kilometres (241 mi) from Ahmedabad to Dandi, Gujarat to make salt himself.
                    Thousands
                    of Indians joined him on this march to the sea. This campaign was one of his most successful at
                    upsetting British hold on India; Britain responded by imprisoning over 60,000 people.
                </li>
                <li><span>1942</span>- Gave a speech calling for the British to quit India for good. This speech was
                    the
                    precursor to the most powerful yet non-violent Quit India movement against the British colonial
                    oppession in India. The British rulers understood that they must cede powers slowly and allow
                    the
                    Indians to self-rule.
                </li>
                <li><span>1944</span>- He was given the popular title of the father of the nation by another
                    legendary
                    revolutionary Subhash Chandra Bose from a radio broadcast from Singapore.
                </li>
                <li><span>1947</span>- India became independent of the British rule.
                </li>
                <li><span>1949</span>- Mahatma was assasinated by Nathuram Godse.
                </li>
